**Two deployment targets:**

| Target | URL | Data source | Live API? |
|--------|-----|-------------|-----------|
| GitHub Pages | https://davevoyles.github.io/Philly-Lax-Viz | Pre-built static JSON | No — `staticLoader.ts` maps `/api/*` to JSON files |
| Azure Container App | (internal, not shared publicly) | Live SQLite via Fastify | Yes — full `/api/*` |

GitHub Pages is the **primary user-facing deployment**. The Azure Container App is used for DB storage (Azure File Share) and as a live API endpoint for admin/development use.

## 2. Package Map

| Package | Path | Role |
|---------|------|------|
| `@pll/ingest` | `packages/ingest/` | Scrapers, parsers, pipelines, migrations, CLI, one-off scripts |
| `@pll/server` | `packages/server/` | Fastify HTTP API + static logo serving + `exportStatic.ts` |
| `@pll/shared` | `packages/shared/` | Single source of truth for TypeScript types (`Team`, `Game`, `Player`, etc.) |
| `@pll/web` | `packages/web/` | Vite + D3 SPA (charts, views, router) |

---

## 3. Data Sources

### 3.1 phillylacrosse.com (RSS)

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| URL pattern | RSS feed items (HTML bodies) |
| Format | HTML embedded in RSS `<description>` |
| Categories | `scoreboard` (score lines), `hs-summaries` (full game recaps) |
| Crawl frequency | Nightly (both categories) |
| Parser files | `scoreboardPost.ts`, `summariesPost.ts`, `text.ts` |
| DB tables populated | `games`, `game_periods`, `players`, `player_stats`, `ingest_anomalies`, `raw_cache_meta`, `ingest_post_log` |

**What it provides:**
- Final scores for all games (via scoreboard posts)
- Quarter-by-quarter breakdowns (via summary posts)
- Per-player stats: goals, assists, ground balls, caused TOs, saves, faceoffs
- Post images (linked from recap pages)

**What it does NOT provide:**
- Shots, clears, turnovers, penalties, attendance
- Goalie save percentage
- Player rosters or profiles
- Games where phillylacrosse.com hasn't published a recap yet (common lag of 1–3 days)

### 3.2 piaad1.org — Rankings

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| URL | `https://www.piaad1.org/sports/spring-sports/lacrosse-b/scores-and-rankings/` |
| Format | HTML table |
| Crawl frequency | Nightly (via `syncPiaa.ts` + `crawl --category=rankings`) |
| Parser files | `piaa.ts` (source), `rankingList.ts` (parser) |
| DB tables populated | `rankings`, `piaa_official_teams` |

**What it provides:**
- Weekly official PIAA District 1 power rankings
- Win/loss/tie records per team (authoritative)

**What it does NOT provide:**
- Strength-of-schedule, streak, last-5 record
- Playoff bracket or seeding context
- Rankings from other PIAA districts

### 3.3 piaad1.org — Schedule CSV

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| URL pattern | `.../export?type=games&year=YYYY&sport=BoysLacrosse` |
| Format | CSV |
| Crawl frequency | Nightly (via `syncPiaa.ts`) |
| Parser files | `piaaSchedule.ts` (source), `scheduleCsv.ts` (parser) |
| DB tables populated | `schedule_games` |

**What it provides:**
- Authoritative full-season schedule (upcoming + completed game dates)
- Home/away raw team names
- Completion flag

**What it does NOT provide:**
- Game time or venue (columns present in DB but always null — source doesn't include them)
- Scores for completed games (use `games` table instead)

### 3.4 maxpreps.com — Team Logos

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| URL patterns | Schools index + per-team logo CDN |
| Format | HTML + image binary |
| Crawl frequency | **Manual only** — `pnpm --filter @pll/ingest sync:logos` |
| Script | `syncLogos.ts` |
| Source files | `maxprepsSchools.ts`, `logoDownload.ts` |
| DB tables populated | `teams.logo_url` (bare filename, e.g. `harriton.png`) |
| Files on disk | `data/logos/*.png` |

**Important:** `logo_url` stores the **bare filename only** (e.g., `harriton.png`). The server prefixes `/logos/` when emitting to clients. Never store full paths or URLs in this column.

**Required attribution:** The web client footer must display: *"Team logos courtesy of MaxPreps.com"*

**What MaxPreps also has (not yet used):** Team schedules, game boxscores (final score only), per-game URLs. The source files `maxprepsSchedule.ts` and `maxprepsGame.ts` exist but are not wired into any nightly pipeline step.

### 3.5 LaxNumbers.com

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| Format | Proprietary API / structured data |
| Crawl frequency | Nightly (via `--source=laxnumbers --since=yesterday --until=today --apply`) |
| DB tables populated | `games`, `player_stats` (additive/supplementary) |

**What it provides:** PA-wide supplementary stats and scores, acting as a secondary source to fill gaps when phillylacrosse.com hasn't published yet.

**Limitation:** Covers yesterday–today window only in nightly run; historical backfill requires manual invocation.

---

## 4. Database Schema

**Location:** `data/lacrosse.db`  
**Engine:** SQLite  
**Current `user_version`:** 4 (migrations 001–004 applied)  
**Test DB:** `data/lacrosse.test.db` — auto-seeded by vitest; **never touch the live DB in tests**

### Tables and approximate row counts (as of 2026-05-16)

| Table | Rows | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `teams` | 235 | All known teams (canonical records) |
| `team_aliases` | 125 | Name variants → canonical team ID |
| `players` | 2,350 | Unique player records |
| `player_aliases` | 1 | Name variants → canonical player ID |
| `games` | 815 | Completed game results |
| `game_periods` | 2,481 | Quarter-by-quarter scores |
| `player_stats` | 9,626 | Per-game per-player stat lines |
| `rankings` | 80 | Weekly PIAA power ranking snapshots |

| `schedule_games` | 180 | Full-season schedule (from PIAA CSV) |
| `ingest_anomalies` | 906 | Parser anomalies / data quality flags |
| `ingest_post_log` | 450 | Record of every processed post |
| `ingest_log` | 24 | Run-level ingest telemetry |
| `raw_cache_meta` | 135 | Fetch cache provenance |
| `post_images` | 87 | Images extracted from recap posts |
| `score_sources` | 49 | Score reconciliation audit trail |
| `dedup_candidates` | 0 | Admin review queue for merge decisions |

### Migrations

| File | What it adds |
|------|-------------|
| `001_init.sql` | Core schema: teams, games, players, player_stats, game_periods, rankings, ingest tables |
| `002_ingest_post_log.sql` | `ingest_post_log` table |
| `003_piaa_official_teams.sql` | `piaa_official_teams` table |
| `004_team_logos.sql` | `teams.logo_url` column |

---

## 5. Ingest Pipeline

### 5.1 Crawl phase (`crawl.ts`)

Downloads raw HTML/RSS/CSV from external sources and writes to `data/raw-cache/`. Does not touch the DB.

**Valid `--category` values:**

| Category | Source | Nightly? |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `hs-summaries` | phillylacrosse.com game recap posts | ✅ Yes |
| `scoreboard` | phillylacrosse.com scoreboard posts | ✅ Yes |
| `rankings` | piaad1.org rankings page | ❌ **No** — gap (see §12) |
| `all` | All of the above | ❌ Not used directly |

### 5.2 Sync phase (scripts)

| Script | What it does | Nightly? |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| `syncPiaa.ts` | Downloads PIAA schedule CSV → `schedule_games`; also syncs rankings | ✅ Yes |
| `syncLogos.ts` | Downloads team logos from MaxPreps → `data/logos/` + `teams.logo_url` | ❌ **Manual only** |

### 5.3 Ingest phase (`ingest.ts`)

Reads from `raw-cache/`, runs parsers, writes structured data to DB.

**Valid `--category` values** (mirrors crawl):

| Category | Nightly? |
|----------|----------|
| `hs-summaries` | ✅ Yes |
| `scoreboard` | ✅ Yes |
| `rankings` | ❌ **No** |
| `all` | ❌ Not used |

### 5.4 LaxNumbers additive ingest

Runs as a separate step: `--source=laxnumbers --since=<yesterday> --until=<today> --apply`

This is additive — it supplements phillylacrosse.com data, not replaces it.

### 5.5 Arg parsing quirks (important for CI)

- `ingest.ts` uses `--db=` flag (NOT `--dbPath=`); throws "Unknown argument" on anything unrecognized
- `crawl.ts` does **not** handle the `--` separator; `ingest.ts` does
- pnpm `--filter` changes CWD to the package directory — always use **absolute paths** for `--db=`
- Set `DB_PATH` env var (absolute path) for both `crawl.ts` and `ingest.ts`

---

## 6. Nightly CI Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/ingest-nightly.yml`  
**Trigger:** Cron (nightly) + manual `workflow_dispatch`  
**Runner:** `[self-hosted, pll]` — Ubuntu container on Mac Mini

### Steps in order

1. Checkout repo
2. Setup pnpm + Node 20 with cache
3. Install Azure CLI (if missing)
4. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
5. Azure login (service principal — `continue-on-error: true` due to expired credentials)
6. **Download `lacrosse.db` from Azure File Share** (or warn if missing)
7. Snapshot pre-ingest anomaly count from `anomalies` table
8. **Crawl `hs-summaries`** — `pnpm --filter @pll/ingest crawl --category=hs-summaries`
9. **Sync PIAA schedule** — `pnpm --filter @pll/ingest exec tsx src/scripts/syncPiaa.ts`
10. **Ingest** — `pnpm --filter @pll/ingest ingest --db=<abs-path> --category=hs-summaries,scoreboard`
11. **LaxNumbers additive ingest** — `--source=laxnumbers --since=... --until=...`
12. Snapshot post-ingest anomaly count
13. Seed team aliases from anomalies
14. Apply community corrections (`applyCorrections.ts`) with `continue-on-error: true`
15. **Upload updated `lacrosse.db` to Azure File Share**
16. Restart Azure Container App revision (conditional on Azure login success)
17. Post anomaly delta to Discord (if webhook configured)
18. Azure logout

### What triggers the Pages deploy

`pages.yml` runs via `workflow_run` (triggered when `ingest-nightly.yml` completes). It:
1. Downloads `lacrosse.db` from Azure File Share
2. Runs `exportStatic.ts` to generate all `/data/**/*.json` files
3. Builds the Vite web bundle
4. Deploys to GitHub Pages

**Raw cache persistence:** `data/raw-cache/` lives on the self-hosted runner between runs. It is NOT downloaded from Azure each night — only the DB is. This means re-running on a fresh runner would start with an empty cache and would re-crawl everything.

---

## 7. Static Export for GitHub Pages

**Script:** `packages/server/src/scripts/exportStatic.ts`  
**Default season:** `2026` (hardcoded in `DEFAULT_SEASON` constant at line 42)

### Files generated

| File path | Replaces API | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| `health.json` | `GET /api/health` | DB row counts + ingest timestamps |

| `{season}/schedule/team/{id}.json` | `GET /api/schedule/team/:id/upcoming` | Per-team upcoming games |
| `{season}/search-index.json` | `GET /api/search` | Pre-built search index (client-filtered) |
| `public/logos/*` | (static assets) | Copied from `data/logos/` |

### How the web client switches modes

- `VITE_STATIC_MODE=true` at build time → client uses `staticLoader.ts`
- `staticLoader.ts` maps `/api/*` paths to pre-built JSON under `/data/...`
- GitHub Pages build sets `VITE_STATIC_MODE=true`, `VITE_BASE_PATH=/Philly-Lax-Viz/`, and `VITE_API_URL` from GitHub Actions secrets

## 8. Web Client & Routing

**Router:** `packages/web/src/router.ts` (hash-based, `#/...`)

| Route | View | Primary data |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `#/` | Dashboard | teams, games, calendar, leaders, freshness |
| `#/teams/:id` | Team detail | team + games + record + rankings + schedule |
| `#/games/:id` | Game detail | game + periods + player stats |
| `#/game/:id` | Game scrubber | same as game detail (alternate layout) |
| `#/players/:id` | Player detail | player + season stats + per-game |
| `#/compare/players` | Compare players | multi-player detail (⚠️ no static export) |
| `#/data-quality` | Data quality | anomalies + PIAA mismatches (⚠️ partial static) |
| `#/leaders` | Leaders | player/team leaderboards + sparklines |
| `#/anomalies` | Anomalies | anomaly list |

## 10. Static Export Coverage Map

### ✅ Fully covered (GitHub Pages works)
Dashboard, Team Detail, Game Detail, Game Scrubber, Player Detail, Leaders, Anomalies, Rivalry Graph, Constellation, Schedule, Status

### ⚠️ Partially covered
| Page | What's missing |
|------|---------------|
| `#/data-quality` | PIAA mismatches endpoint has no static export; anomaly list still works |
| `#/sources` | Freshness data not statically exported; page shows degraded state |
| `#/h2h` | Team and player H2H endpoints have no static export; H2H page shows empty |

### ❌ Not covered (intentional or known gap)
| Page | Status |
|------|--------|
| `#/compare/players` | Falls back to `empty.json`; compare feature non-functional on Pages |
| `#/admin/dedup` | Admin tool — intentionally excluded from static export |

---

## 11. Key Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: SQLite as the primary database
**Decision:** Use SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`) rather than a hosted database.  
**Why:** The entire dataset is small enough to fit in one file (<50MB), the ingest pipeline runs on a single machine (Mac Mini self-hosted runner), and SQLite requires no separate server process. The DB file is uploaded to Azure File Share and downloaded at the start of each nightly run — effectively using Azure as a persistence layer.  
**Trade-off:** Concurrent writes are not supported. The pipeline is designed to be single-writer. Read-heavy API queries are fine.

### ADR-002: GitHub Pages as primary deployment, not Azure
**Decision:** GitHub Pages is the user-facing URL; Azure Container App is internal.  
**Why:** GitHub Pages is free, requires no credential rotation, is always available, and has no cold-start latency. The Azure SWA/Container App has API routing complexity and credential maintenance overhead. For a read-heavy sports stats site, pre-built static JSON is sufficient for all user-facing views.  
**Trade-off:** Dynamic features (compare players, H2H, admin dedup, PIAA mismatches) are not available on GitHub Pages. These degrade gracefully to empty states.

### ADR-003: Static JSON export instead of API proxy at deploy time
**Decision:** `exportStatic.ts` pre-generates all JSON responses at deploy time.  
**Why:** Avoids needing a live API server for GitHub Pages. All data is deterministic at export time (it's a snapshot). Client-side filtering (search) works on pre-built indexes.  
**Trade-off:** Data is stale until the next nightly deploy. The freshness timestamp (`lastIngestAt`) is visible in the dashboard and sources page so users can see when data was last updated.

### ADR-004: Season hardcoded to 2026
**Decision:** `DEFAULT_SEASON = 2026` in `exportStatic.ts`, `seasons.ts`, and `staticLoader.ts`.  
**Why:** Multi-season support was not needed at build time. Adding it requires parameterizing all queries and the static export loop.  
**Trade-off:** At the end of the 2026 season, this value needs to be updated in at least 3 places before the 2027 season begins.

### ADR-005: PIAA schedule and phillylacrosse games are separate tables
**Decision:** `schedule_games` (from PIAA) and `games` (from phillylacrosse.com) are never merged into one table.  
**Why:** They serve different purposes. `schedule_games` is authoritative for upcoming game dates; `games` is authoritative for final scores and player stats. Merging them would lose provenance and make it harder to show "upcoming games" without hallucinating results.  
**Trade-off:** Team pages need to query both tables. The "upcoming games" section on team detail reads `schedule_games WHERE game_date >= today`.

### ADR-006: logo_url stores bare filename only
**Decision:** `teams.logo_url = 'harriton.png'` (no path prefix).  
**Why:** The server prefixes `/logos/` at API response time. This keeps the DB portable — the logos directory could move without requiring a DB migration.  
**Trade-off:** Consumers of the raw DB must know to prepend the prefix.

### ADR-007: Raw cache lives on the runner, not in Azure
**Decision:** `data/raw-cache/` is NOT uploaded to Azure File Share. It persists on the self-hosted runner between runs.  
**Why:** The raw cache can be large (many HTML files) and uploading/downloading it on every run would significantly increase pipeline time. The runner machine (Mac Mini) is stable and always available.  
**Trade-off:** If the runner is wiped or replaced, the raw cache is lost. A fresh run will re-crawl everything, which is expensive but correct.

## 12. Known Limitations & Tech Debt

### Pipeline gaps (not in nightly run)

| Gap | Impact | Effort to fix |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| `rankings` category not crawled/ingested nightly | Rankings only update when PIAA sync runs (which does get rankings via `syncPiaa.ts`) | Low — add `--category=rankings` to crawl step |
| `syncLogos.ts` not run nightly | Team logos go stale when new teams join or MaxPreps updates images | Low — add step; logos rarely change mid-season |
| Dedup scripts not run nightly (`dedupTeams`, `dedupPlayers`, etc.) | Duplicate team/player entries accumulate over time | Medium — needs review workflow for false positives |
| No nightly failure threshold on anomaly growth | Anomaly count can spike (parser regression) with no alert | Low — add a step that fails if delta > N |
| `piaaCheckTotals.ts`, `reconcileTeamScores.ts` not run nightly | Score reconciliation drift not detected automatically | Medium |
| `auditCrossChecks.ts` not run nightly | Cross-source data consistency not verified | Medium |

### Static export gaps

| Gap | Impact | Effort to fix |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| `/api/compare/players` has no static export | Compare Players page non-functional on GitHub Pages | Medium — requires pre-generating all player-pair combinations (combinatorially large) |
| `/api/h2h/teams` and `/api/h2h/players` have no static export | H2H page non-functional on GitHub Pages | Medium — same combinatorial challenge |
| `/api/data-quality/piaa-mismatches` has no static export | Data Quality page partially broken on GitHub Pages | Low — can export as a single JSON file |
| `/api/freshness` has no static export | Sources page shows degraded state | Low — export a `freshness.json` snapshot at deploy time |
| `/api/posts/images` has no static export | Post images may not appear on GitHub Pages | Low — bundle into game detail JSON |

### Data quality

| Issue | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| Player attribution is heuristic | `summariesPost.ts` uses `currentSubHeader`/`playerStatTeamHints` to assign stats to teams — ambiguous cases become anomalies |
| Over-cap stats are zeroed | `playerStat.ts` clamps values above caps to 0 rather than preserving and flagging |
| `schedule_games.game_time` / `location` always null | PIAA CSV doesn't include time or venue data |
| `rankingList.ts` `weekStart` not parseable | Caller must inject the week start date; if missing it's blank |
| MaxPreps game parser only gets final score | Quarter splits and stat tables not parsed from `maxprepsGame.ts` |

### Season transition

When the 2027 season begins, update:
1. `exportStatic.ts` — `DEFAULT_SEASON` constant
2. `packages/server/src/routes/seasons.ts` — hardcoded season list
3. `packages/web/src/staticLoader.ts` — default season for static path resolution

---

## 13. Community Corrections Operations

### Required manual step after first deploy

The Azure Container App (`pll-server`) must have `https://davevoyles.github.io` added to its
`CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable. Without this, correction POSTs from GitHub Pages will be
blocked by CORS.

Steps:
1. Go to Azure Portal -> Container Apps -> pll-server -> Settings -> Environment variables
2. Edit `CORS_ORIGINS` to include `https://davevoyles.github.io` (comma-separated)
3. Save and wait for the container to redeploy

### Required GitHub Actions secret

Add `VITE_API_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret (Settings -> Secrets -> Actions):
- Value: the Azure Container Apps URL for the server (for example, `https://pll-server.<hash>.azurecontainerapps.io`)
- This is used by the GitHub Pages build to POST corrections to the live API

### Correction lifecycle

1. User submits via the edit button -> `POST /api/corrections` -> stored as `pending`
2. Nightly ingest runs (`ingest-nightly.yml`)
3. `applyCorrections.ts` runs after ingest, applies all `pending` non-outlier corrections
4. Outlier corrections (for example, goals: 2 -> 200) are marked `outlier` and skipped
5. Applied corrections survive re-ingest because `applyCorrections.ts` runs after ingest each night
